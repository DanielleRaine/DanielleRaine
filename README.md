Hey, everyone, I'm Danielle!<br><br>

<br><br>
About Me:<br>
I am an undergrad at UT Dallas studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I am passionate about learning new things in and out of my field while bringing positivity and total effort to my work and play!<br>
<br>
I often dig deeper to learn why certain things work the way they do. Understanding a topic requires analyzing all of its moving parts, seen and unseen. I love using the knowledge that I find to help my peers and work on fun projects! Speaking of projects, check them out here on GitHub! My LinkedIn is listed in my profile.<br>
<br>
I am looking for internship/research opportunities in mathematics, machine learning, software development, data science, and game development. My goal is to explore the cutting edge of technology as a researcher to help everyone live the life that makes them happy.<be>
<br>
Remember to stay safe, make logical decisions, and drink a lot of water!<br>
